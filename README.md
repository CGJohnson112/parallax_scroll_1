# parallax_scroll_1
horizontal parallax scroll background (3 panels)
Up until very recently, the only website I've seen that resembles this site was this one: https://djashtonmartin.com/.

To compete with the developer who designed this (without using ANY of the source code), 
I was able to develop my own basic scrolling platform that can be modified to suit with graphics and image. 
The intent of this is simply a landing page for any specific content of the site, which can be accessed by clicking on one of the buttons 
(inactive on TEXT TWO and THREE).
